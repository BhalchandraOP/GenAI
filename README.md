# GenAI Event Website -- bhala

## Project Summary

This project is a modern, single-page website for a one-day event called the "Innovate & Inspire Conference". It was generated by Gemini and is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The styling is handled by Bootstrap, following Material Design principles for a clean and responsive layout.

The website features several sections:
*   **Hero Section:** A welcoming banner with the event title and a call-to-action.
*   **About:** A brief introduction to the conference.
*   **Schedule:** A timeline of the day's events.
*   **Speakers:** A showcase of the event's speakers.
*   **Location:** Venue information with an embedded map.
*   **Registration:** A simple form for attendees to register.

## Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)

### 1. Local Development

To run and test the website on your local machine, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory**
```bash
cd event-website
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
If you haven't already, install the necessary Node.js packages.
```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3: Start the Development Server**
This command will start a local server (usually on `http://localhost:5173`) and automatically open the website in your default browser. The server will watch for file changes and update the site automatically.
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Building for Production

When you are ready to deploy the website, you need to create an optimized production build.

**Step 1: Run the Build Command**
This command will compile the TypeScript and React code and bundle all the assets into a `dist` folder.
```bash
npm run build
```

The contents of the `dist` folder are what you would deploy to a static web host.

### 3. Pushing to GitHub

These steps outline how to push your code to a GitHub repository.

**Step 1: Initialize Git**
(This has already been done)
```bash
git init
```

**Step 2: Stage Your Changes**
Add all the files in the project to the staging area.
```bash
git add .
```

**Step 3: Commit Your Changes**
Commit the staged files with a descriptive message.
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

**Step 4: Link to Your GitHub Repository**
Create a new, empty repository on GitHub. Then, link your local repository to it. **Replace `BhalchandraOP/GenAI` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/BhalchandraOP/GenAI.git
```

**Step 5: Push Your Code**
Push your `main` branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
